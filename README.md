## Sprint 1
**Goals**
Set-up:
- Model
- WPF
- Controller
- Test
- Connect MVC

### Review
- Relations between Product and Order table were wrong
- User stories need to be more detailed

### Retro
**What went well**
- The MVC was connected, I could retrieve the data from the database to the view.

**What went wrong**
- Not having a full grasp with EntityFramework I have struggled to understand how to update my migration after I have changed my Model.
- I had to re-setup my project from scratch
